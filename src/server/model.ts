    Jason BLANDA is the Co-Founder + Lead artist, Raised in the garden state, Jay started his art career as a 2D/3D character animator in video games, film and tv. His very first sunrise trip to deep playa, in 2015, was a magical revelation of extraordinary art that inspired him to his very core. While animation kept him in touch with his child like imagination, Burning Man showed him artist and audience.  It was then he knew that purging his playful creativity in Black Rock City was not only possible but inevitable. 

    Andrew LAZORCHAK is the Co-founder + Lead artist, Born in Massachusetts, raised in NJ and living in Napa Valley, Drew started out his career as a budding architect & branding designer in NYC and Amsterdam.  He has since launched his own wine accessories/barware company, which allowed him to be on the west coast and revive his roots in alternative communities, installation art, and dance music.  His affinity for festival culture, music and art has fueled his passion and imagination for Byte.
